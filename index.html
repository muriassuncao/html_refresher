<h1>House Music All Night Long
</h1>

	  <p align=center> "Not everyone understands House Music. It's a spiritual thing. A body thing. A soul thing." - <i>Eddie Amador</i>

	 <h2>A Little History</h2>
	 <br>


	 Call it another gift from the gays to the straight universe. House Music had its humble beginning in 1977 at The Warehouse, a gay club in Chicago, patronized mainly by the black and latino community. The Warehouse's D.J. Frankie Knuckles, universally considered the <i>Godfather of House </i> experimented with Disco, a new European electronic sound, drums, and soul to create a "rawer" and "deeper" sound that would shape generations to come. <br>

	 <br>

	 Some of today's subgenres of the original Chicago House include:
	
	 		<ul>
	 		<li> Deep House</li>
	 		<li> Tech House</li>
	 		<li> Tribal House</li>
	 		<li> Electro House (well, maybe you can ship this one)</li> 
	 		<li> Funky House</li>
	 		<li> Gospel House</li>
	 		<li> UK Garage</li>
	 		<li> Trance (skippable, as well)</li>
	 		<li> Jackin' House</li>
	 		<li> Soulful house</li?>
</ul>
